<h1>The Blog of Tcal-X</h1>
  
  Why "tcal-x" ?   Well, my work login "tcal" was already taken at GitHub.  
  When I thought of "x" as an arbitrary extension, "tcal-x" stuck in my head
  because it combined "tcal" (of course) and "kalx" -- the UC Berkeley student-run
  radio station.   KALX had introduced me to the Smashing Pumpkins, Massive Attack,
  and maybe Green Day (I can't remember I first heard Green Day on KALX, or live on
  Lower Sproul Plaza....).

  This is a placeholder until I get the real blog set up.
